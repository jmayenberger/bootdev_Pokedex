# Pokedex REPL Project

This is a fully-functional Pokedex REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) application that fetches data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). The project features an efficient caching system, a suite of additional tests, and was developed using the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD).

## Features

- Interactive command-line REPL experience
- Fetches and caches PokeAPI data for performance
- Robust unit and integration tests
- Extensible design for future enhancements

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [Vitetest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing

## Test Driven Development

This project was built using a TDD workflow. All features were implemented by first writing tests, ensuring both correctness and maintainability.
